      How DIGI Works
    </p>
    <p class="basic"> 
      We've crafted a streamlined four-step process to ensure you can establish meaningful connections effortlessly. Let's walk you through the DGCE journey:

    1. Deduco – The Beginning of Your Connection
  </p>
  <p class="basic"> 
    Your journey starts with Deduco, where you take the initiative to connect with someone. Whether you're inviting a friend or reaching out to a new acquaintance, this step is all about making the first move. Simply refer the person to chat on DIGI, and the process begins.
  </p>
  <p class="mini-title"> 
    2. Generation – Creating Your Access
  </p>
  <p class="basic"> 
    Once the invitation is received, it's time for Generation. In this step, the second user generates a unique token. This token is a digital key that will enable the connection, ensuring both users are securely linked.
  </p>
  <p class="mini-title">
    3. Connection – Bridging the Gap
  </p>
  <p class="basic"> 
    With a valid token in hand, it's time for Connection. The first user enters the token, bridging the gap between the two parties. This is where the magic happens, as both users are brought together on the platform.   
  </p>
  <p class="mini-title">
    4. Establishment – Connection Achieved
  </p>
  <p class="basic"> 
    Finally, we reach Establishment. At this stage, the connection is fully established, and both users are now linked on DIGI. From here, the conversation can flow freely, with DIGI facilitating a seamless and engaging chat experience.
  </p>
